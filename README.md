# SnakeGame (C#/.NET Console Project)

Implementation of the game "Snake" for the "Software Engineering" course for my university.
The aim is to set up a small game (Snake) with a thought out structure, class diagram, unit tests and documentation.

## Game description
Snake runs in a console.
- Controlled by **arrow keys**
- Eating ('*') heightens the snake's length and the score
- Game ends upon **colliding with a wall** or **colliding with itself**
